<p><h1>Receive</h1></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">Coin Address:</span></p>
<p><span>This address is used to send and receive payments. It can also be used to receive contracts. When a contract is sent to a coin address, the other party must burn some coins to bypass the spam filter.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">BitMessage Address:</span></p>
<p><span>If enabled, it can be used to send and receive </span><span style="font-weight:800;">contracts</span><span>. This is email without a server. Its fully decentralized. The only drawback is its not always as fast as encrypted email and messages run the risk of being lost although this is very unlikely. Bitmessage is constantly improving and advancing and the most recent version is very reliable. Messages will stay in the memory of the network for 2 days at a time. Your program wll try to resend messages after that point. We definitely recommend staying connected so you can receive messages and updates from the markets. In order to post to Halo markets BitMessage must be enabled. When involved in contracts you must keep Halo running to ensure the delivery of messages.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">Email Address:</span></p>
<p><span>This can be used to receive payments or contracts. It is also a fully decentralized layer on top of email since many providers can be used and the information is encrypted. Its also a user friendly way to get involved into coins. You can see the list of supported providers at the bottom of this page. We recommend setting up a Gmail that you use exclusively for Halo. When you add an email, Halo will save your password so it can automatically perform your contracts.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">Outbox:</span></p>
<p><span>The outbox at the bottom is used to track outgoing messages. When sending an offer to the market, your computer performs some work for network security. You can watch as the work gets completed and the message is sent. This window will track both Bitmessage and Email. Also if any message does not get sent for some reason, the program will try and alert you.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">Supported email providers:</span></p>
<p><span>Google</span></p>
<p><span>Hotmail</span></p>
<p><span>Outlook</span></p>
<p><span>AOL</span></p></body></html>
