<p><h1>Contracts</h1></p>
<br />
<p><span>The heart of any coin is its contracting system. Money can be programmed to do amazing things. This panel gives you full and custom control of you life's finances and negotiations. Its one of the most secure ways to do business in the world. The way you structure your contract is key to making it unbreakable. If you are unsure of what to do, please use one of the </span><span style="font-weight:800;">templates</span><span> on the home page. </span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">Description:</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>The description should try and let the party know as much about the deal in advance. If there is any funding info such as bank information, western union or anything else, you would want to mention it now. Remember, once these contracts are signed they are permanent. So be as descriptive as possible. If you get any counter offers, please be sure to read them.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">Image:</span></p>
<p><span>The image you attach should be small in size. To reduce the traffic, consider using links to images in your description. If you go over the size limit, Halo will inform you and tell you how to proceed.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">Send Contract to:</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>This is where you want to put their address. Its possible to pay any of the addresses in the receive tab. If you pay a coin address such as Bitcoin, Blackcoin Baycoin etc, you will have to pay a fee to get past the spam blocker. If you negotiate in Bitmessage, be patient. If you experience delays the other party may not be connected. Always give lots of time to let the deal fund. In Blackcoin, deals have been known to fund in a few minutes. However, it can take hours sometimes depending on if they are online, if the message needed to be sent again or if there was a delay in the network.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">Amount:</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>The amount is an advance on the payment. So if you are buying a guitar for 200 coins, you enter that amount here. This sends the payment into the contract with the deposits. Once you and the other party are happy, you can agree to release the funds to them. If you cannot come to an agreement it can be canceled. The minimum amount you can enter is 5500 satoshis(.00005500), which is the closest thing to zero.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>The fees are split between parties. There are 3 transactions and 2 are split. So that means its a total of 2 fees to perform a contract.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">The deposits:</span></p>
<p><span>This is where all the strategy comes in. If you are not experienced in contracting, its best to do a template and let Halo set these for you. The deposits are made depending on the level of trust. If you trust the person, you can always set these as low as possible. If you do not trust them then they should match the value entered in the amount field or they should be at least double the value of whatever you are negotiating. For example, if selling a guitar for 200, both parties would enter 200 in each field. That makes for a total of 600 in escrow. At no point could a party walk from the deal with more or equal than what he came in with until the deal is completed. The deposits are always returned once both parties agree.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>Here is another example. If one was to perform an employment or barter contract, they may want to set the amount close to zero and make the deposits double the amount of the deal. So an employee working for 50 a day would put 100 in escrow along with the employers 100. They would have to act in good faith since the value deposited was double the days wage. If the job goes well, they can extend the contract another day without making a new contract! Then the employer just pays normally outside of the contract. If it doesn't go well both employer and employee must work together and sort out their differences.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>There are countless strategies here for conducting good business. The most important thing to remember is, these contracts keep parties honest with each other since it is two party escrow. Only the two parties involved can decide if the deal was fair.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">Time to Complete:</span></p>
<p><span>This is probably the most important field. Set this time for at least a week. Give lots of time for misunderstandings and delays. If you find you are getting close to the deadline, you can send extension requests. If you and the counter party cannot come to any agreement and the time runs out, the funds get destroyed! This is what gives the contract an unbreakable nature. Especially if both parties limit communication to Halo.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">Preparing for delays:</span></p>
<p><span>You are able to monitor contracts with only ONE key connected. So it is possible to give one of your account keys to your wife, friend or other family member in case you are unable to sign. Always try to be well prepared.</span></p></body></html>
