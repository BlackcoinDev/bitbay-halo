<p><h1>History</h1></p>
<br />
<p><span>Many different things are shown on this tab. First your address is listed as well as your available balance. Also, the amount of keys you have connected is listed, a refresh button and two detailed history panels. In some cases, it may be possible to click on or interact with outgoing orders in the list such as &quot;Pay To Email&quot; or &quot;Two Step Send&quot;.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>The account details panel shows pending orders. Sometimes you can interact with the order on this tab. For example, if you send coins and they never confirm, you can cancel. Also, if you have a two step send it would be listed here. Contracts are listed here too. Unconfirmed transactions are listed when incoming. Any exotic contracts or inputs will be listed here as well.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">Account Details:</span></p>
<p><span>Halo has revolutionized the change system to be highly efficient for merchants. The cash in the account is split just like in the real world into 5 and 10 dollar bills. There are 11 different denominations and their sizes are different for every coin. Halos change can be seen at the bottom where it says &quot;show change&quot;. Now when you spend coins your change is perfectly divided so you can perform hundreds of negotiations at once. If you pay yourself, it lists it in the details.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">Account History:</span></p>
<p><span>This is where the user can go to keep track of all their purchases, contracts and history. They can put labels on things to remind them of what it was. Clicking on the details will give the full details of the transaction. At the bottom, you have the option to export to CSV. This can be incredibly useful for accounting purposes. If you are running a business you will want to use that feature. If you decide you want to clear the history, you can do that as well.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">What is Synchronizing?</span></p>
<p><span>For all currencies, you must download the &quot;Blockchain&quot; or the &quot;history&quot; of all the transactions ever made in the coin. This is what keeps it secure! So, if you send coins to your address, you need to be at 100%</span><span style="font-weight:800;"> </span><span>to know your entire balance. What if your balance is incorrect? If the progress bar is 100% and the balance is not correct, then you can click &quot;Rescan&quot;. This can take up to an hour sometimes depending on your computers speed. So please do not do this unless its totally necessary.</span></p>
