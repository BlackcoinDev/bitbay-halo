<p><h1>Open Contracts</h1></p>
<br />
<p><span>Here is where is all the fun takes place. Contracts are listed here and some may be completed automatically while others will require your attention. Clicking on a contract will bring up an entire interface for viewing and managing them. You will have many different options in each contract. Some may be different than others depending on the deal. There you will be able to confirm the deal, cancel it, send filtered messages, confirmations numbers and more.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>The time limit is listed here. Don't let it get too low or face potential default. When you feel like the contract is complete, you can send your partner a confirmation request. Once they agree and send one as well, the contract will start to broadcast. Then it will automatically clear itself.</span></p></body></html>
