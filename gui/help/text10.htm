<p><h1>Market</h1></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">Intro:</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to the first global decentralized market! This system can connect anyone in the world with the click of a button. Here you can find jobs, employ people, barter goods like gold for corn or wheat for rice, trade coins, buy coins with cash, make loans, make bets, make derivatives, sell real estate, and basically perform any deal you could fathom in the real world.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>This system is even much more powerful than systems such as E-Bay, Amazon or Alibaba since the contracts are </span><span style="font-weight:800;">unbreakable. </span><span>Therefore, theft and deception are very unlikely in this system. For the first time ever, it is possible to wire money anywhere in the world and not fear theft, its possible to trade in countries without banks, so many wonderful things are possible here. There is also a highly advanced reputation and whitelisting system which allows for user feedback. So even though it is anonymous, sellers and buyers will be known by their rating. Although it is possible to use arbiters, we recommend against it due to concerns of collusion. Also, middle men have always had the inability to judge others fairly and they usually end up taking sides and raising the cost of business. Finally the world is now free from third parties.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">Search:</span></p>
<p><span>This simple search will allow you to find anything you are looking for. It is possible in the future we can build a full interface of recommendations. You can filter what you see by choosing what you search for on the left of the search field.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>By changing the category of what you are searching for, this also changes how search results are displayed! This is extremely useful for different templates that may have different areas of interest to potential customers.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>If you want to sort the search results, you can do so by right clicking on a field and choosing &quot;Sort Ascending&quot; or &quot;Sort Descending&quot;. Then the table will display a little arrow at the top of it that you can click on to reverse and sort the orders.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">Interacting with orders:</span></p>
<p><span>When left clicking on an order, all of the details of an oder will show. All of the templates have a different appearance. When you interact with an order you may be able to accept, counter-offer, bid, request a different amount, barter, or supply additional information. If you find an offer that is spam or does not belong in the market, you may right click on an order and flag it. Be careful about using this feature too often as it will negatively impact your rating and you only get a few flags per month. It takes multiple flags to remove an order. If you hold a moderation key, you will notice extra options in the dropdown menu.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">Select Market:</span></p>
<p><span>From the dropdown box you may select any of your subscribed markets. The default market is the Halo Market in BitHalo/BlackHalo and BitBay within BitBay. You may post with any currency in any market. You may only accept an order in the currency it was offered. If the market was just added it might take a moment to appear in the box. </span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">Post Offer:</span></p>
<p><span>Just like at the home page, you can select from one of the templates and post an offer to the market.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">Settings:</span></p>
<p><span>In many of the templates you are asked for personal information such as bank information or western union details or contact details. This gets saved for future deals. You can edit that information here. You may also be able to change all kinds of advanced settings concerning the behavior of markets and the behavior of Halo.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">The whitelist system:</span></p>
<p><span>The main markets for Halo, BitBay and NightTrader can be whitelisted to allow for moderation and increased speed. This is a fusion between two worlds. The consumer friendly internet combined with the decentralized free internet. To protect the virtue of these markets, Halo with automatically embed the encrypted IP address of the person posting the order. This is to deter bad actors and allow for controlling bots. The reputation system allows for the creation of decentralized moderation and whitelists. A whitelist is a private network of nodes within Bitmessage or any other network. The whitelisted markets are decentralized and serverless. We believe that serverless internet is the future and this is the first step. We have a special moderator version of Halo as a reward for good behavior and it will allow users to manage markets. You may also add or join a different market. The users of markets have the ability to flag orders and if done enough times would render the order invisible. Too much flagging can cause a ban from whitelists or servers. It is not our job to control the internet, especially a decentralized one.  However, we have laid down the framework for it to be self regulating. Please lets keep the markets clean so decentralization has a chance to reach the masses.</span></p></body></html>
