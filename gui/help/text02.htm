<p><h1>Send</h1></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">Available and Actual balance:</span></p>
<p><span>Different things will effect the money you have that is available. Like cash, money must be set aside for contracts, joint expenses and partial transactions. This reflects in your actual balance and can be seen in great detail in the history tab.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">Pay To, Amount and Fee:</span></p>
<p><span>The Pay To field should contain their coin address. For example, if you are using BlackHalo, it must be Blackcoin. If its BitHalo, BitBay or any other coin, you must use the correct address for that coin. You can find your address in the home or receive tabs. The little icon to the right of the address allows you to copy it.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>The amount should be entered in decimal point. An entire Bitcoin would be 1. The smallest fraction of a Bitcoin for example is 0.00000001 which is also called a &quot;Satoshi&quot;. The minimum amount is 0.00005500 Satoshis. This is enforced by the miners (the people who verify transactions).</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>If you wish, you can enter your amounts in US Dollars by typing a dollar sign &quot;$&quot; in front of your payment (for example $1). When you do this, Halo will check the exchange rate online and confirm it with you. You may wish to double check that rate to be certain of its accuracy. </span></p>
<br />
<p><span>Halo is completely FREE software. The fee you see here is for the network security and it is paid to the miners. Every coin has a different mining system. In Blackcoin for example, the miners are the actual users. So anyone running the program is mining. You get paid interest for staying connected to the network. This calculates out to 1% a year. You also get these fees as a reward for verifying transactions. In Bitcoin, mining is a competition. People from all over the world compete to solve math puzzles and the reward is the mining fees. The reason for the mining system is to maintain security in the network.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>Halo calculates fees based on the size of the transaction. The fee you see here is only a recommendation. However, since miners get paid for validating transactions, its good to simply allow Halo to make these recommendations for you. If the fee needs to be higher, Halo will inform you.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">Pay To Email:</span></p>
<p><span>You may choose to pay an email address. This is a much more user friendly way to pay people. When sending to an email we recommend that you send to one of the supported email providers that can be used in Halo such as Gmail or Hotmail. When you send to email, coins will be hidden inside of an image within the email. You may choose to change that image with one of your own and you can also send a personal message with the email. We recommend you send the payments with a password so the payment is secure. You will have to inform the recipient of the password so they can redeem it in Halo. When they open Halo, they only need to add their email to the account and it will be automatically redeemed.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">Advanced Sending:</span></p>
<p><span>In a joint account, it may be necessary to pay out multiple people at the same time. So this box makes it easy for you to send to everyone involved instantly and simultaneously. You can send to multiple addresses and multiple amounts.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>You may also pay to an email address. This is the new &quot;paypal friendly&quot; way to send money world wide! This involves making a one way payment to an email which they can collect automatically by following the instructions. If they are running Halo, it will automatically perform the send. If you receive payments by email its very important to protect your login. We do our best to encrypt the information however sending to a coin address will always be more secure. Please understand that this feature is exclusive to Halo and so they will be informed to download the software if they don't already have it.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>There is also automatic forwarding of joint expenses and automatic signing of joint expenses. Forwarding makes it so that Halo will remember the email of your second party or location. Automatic signing makes it so all the joint expenses you get offered, will get automatically signed off on. Be careful with that feature if you are working with a partner since it will authorize them to spend at their leisure. However, you have to keep Halo running so it can sign. The feature was designed for high security accounts. It is useful when you want to use two computers for your account instead of one. This means, your account can not be hacked since it will rely on two different locations for storing keys.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">Two Step Sending:</span></p>
<p><span>This process is for joint accounts with a partner or situations where you have only one key connected and wish to pay using two computers. How it works is, you fill out the payment form and create the first signature. Then depending on your preferences, Halo will either automatically complete the payment or you may send it manually to the other location/party. They will then perform Step 2 or that step will get completed automatically depending on preferences in Advanced Sending. If you chose to skip the sending process, you can save the signature file and send it manually. If it is sent manually, then Step 2 simply involves opening the file created in Step 1.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">Making Change:</span></p>
<p><span>Since you may want to perform lots of contracts, you can break for change by putting your own address in the &quot;Send To&quot; field. This makes Halo split all of your inputs into pieces for negotiating transactions of many different sizes. If you don't break for change, Halo will do this for you every time you spend automatically.</span></p></body></html>
