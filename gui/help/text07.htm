<p><h1>Instant Refund</h1></p>
<br />
<p><span>Generally, the Instant Refund is not used. However, for very high security deals it is recommended. The instant refund is used to ensure the destruction transaction is not invalidated by the party that broadcasts. By default, the buyer usually broadcasts since they make a larger commitment into escrow. We recommend that the party paying the larger amount also pays an extra deposit into escrow which will get immediately refunded. The refund is signed in advance and it is useful to prevent the person broadcasting the transaction from tampering with the raw transaction enough to alter the transaction ID. Since the refund is based on that ID, it guarantees that the ID won't be altered. If a miner changes the ID, this client automatically resigns the contracts with the other party in escrow. More can be read about the Halo protocol in the documentation and whitepaper. Think of it like receiving change. You/they would pay a larger denomination to get it back as change the moment the deal is signed.</span></p></body></html>
