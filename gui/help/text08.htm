<p><h1>Pending Offers</h1></p>
<br />
<p><span>This tab is where all offers go before agreement. You are able to look over them all, review them, accept them, counter-offer, and delete them. Whenever an offer comes in, you get notified in the client. However you may choose to disable that. When you click on an offer that brings up a window where you can see everything that is going on with it.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>Once an offer is accepted, you will see the Halo client start negotiating. Please always have the Halo program running or else the deal can not progress. The two peers must be able to talk to each other at all times. If you accept an order and the transaction is not progressing, its possible the other party has deleted the offer or they are ignoring you. You can simply cancel the contract at this point. Although its always good to wait a few days, they may be busy or perhaps their computer is off. You can cancel at any time except during the broadcast phase. If the deal is broadcasting, that means it is sending the contract to the network. Please be patient if it takes more time than expected. If the deal never goes to escrow, you can cancel it. In order to cancel a broadcast you need both keys connected since it will be forced to spend the funds to ensure they do not go to escrow.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>Once the broadcasting finishes, it will be moved to the open contracts page. There are a few other options on this page that are important. First, you may disable the spam filter. This allows you to see all the private offers sent to your account. If the spam filter is enabled, then parties must pay a small amount to the coin network to contract with you. It forces them to pay your coin address such as Bitcoin, Blackcoin or BitBay address.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>Filtering &quot;Non-Market Offers&quot; is a feature that keeps people from sending you unwanted messages and private offers while you are involved in filtered negotiation. Its a great tool to prevent spam, excuses or pressure from the party you are contracting with. Basically, when you post an order to market, anyone should be able to contact you. But if you don't have any orders in the market then nobody can contact you. If you want people to contact you for private offers outside of the market then do not enable this filter.</span></p></body></html>
