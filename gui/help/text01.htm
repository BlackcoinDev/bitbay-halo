<p><h1>Welcome to Halo v1.0</h1></p>
<p><span>Finally, smart contracts have arrived! There is no 3rd party, no fees to an escrow, no escrow agent, no middle man, no altcoin, and no governing body. Halo is famously known for the worlds first </span><span style="font-weight:800;">unbreakable smart contracts</span><span>. This means, the they apply to real world situations. No middle men are needed such as insurance, lawyers, escrow etc. Two parties can form a bond using coins and make an agreement that cannot be broken. This can potentially change the entire world economy. As a result, you can barter, trade cash, employ, find jobs, trade coins, international trade, back currencies, make bets, derivatives, microtrade or make unbreakable contracts with a partner. These are only examples. There is now an entire universe at your fingertips. Services will now be cheaper, faster, more efficient and nobody will be able to lie or steal again under one of these contracts because YOU now have the POWER to enforce the deal.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">How does it work?</span></p>
<p><span> Using deposits, both parties make the risk of default higher than the value of what is being negotiated. Since the deposits are adjustable, we can make them high, low or nonexistent depending on trust level. Halo does this for you automatically so you don't have to. Then if the parties cannot agree, the funds get destroyed. There is the deposits for each party and an amount. The amount and both deposits are advanced to a joint account when the contract starts. Since each party only has 50% control of the joint account, they must come to an agreement before the time runs out. Both parties can also choose from many options once the contract has started. Such as time extensions, sending western union numbers or refunding everyone's money. Any change must be agreed on by both people so its always fair. With the templates at the home page, a whole new world of user friendly features will be available at your fingertips.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">The Home Page and Templates</span></p>
<p><span>The home page makes the whole process easy for you. We have a &quot;one click&quot; policy where everything should take as few clicks as possible. So now, your parents, grandparents and those not familiar with a computer or coins can easily navigate the program. Every Template will be your guide to fast completion of all your tasks. If anyone contacts you with an offer, a notification will pop up on the right hand side.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>The video library shows you visually how everything works and it also shows you all the exciting news about Halo. </span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">Switching coins and your Address</span></p>
<p><span>The button to switch coins allows you to see entire entirely different economies and communities. Your address will change and you will be able to work in different currencies. Blackcoin and Bitcoin were the original smart contracts. And BlackHalo was the first ever multicoin program in the world! It was also the first program to use more than one key for your account. This is also called &quot;multisignature&quot;. Use your address to request payments from others.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">What is Synchronizing?</span></p>
<p><span>For all currencies, you must download the &quot;Blockchain&quot; or the &quot;history&quot; of all the transactions ever made in Bitcoin. This is what keeps it secure! So, if you send coins to your address, you need to be at 100%</span><span style="font-weight:800;"> </span><span>to know your entire balance. What if your balance is incorrect? If the progress bar is 100% and the balance is not correct, then you can click &quot;Rescan&quot;. This can take up to an hour sometimes depending on your computers speed. So please do not do this unless its totally necessary.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">Why doesn't Bitcoin have a synchronizing bar?</span></p>
<p><span>Good question, because we use online services such as Electrum, BitEasy and Blockchain.info to confirm balances and inputs. We pull from multiple sites for two reasons. Mainly because the Bitcoin history/blockchain takes days to download! It is also many gigabytes of storage on the computer. So we use multiple sites for secure information that is accurate and consistent. They help us know the history by sharing their data with us.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">Are there any fees?</span></p>
<p><span>This program is completely FREE there is not any fees. The only fees you pay are mining fees which do not go to Halo. You can however donate to us, so we can continue to make wonderful software.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">What is Bitcoin? Why should I use it instead of cash?</span></p>
<p><span>Bitcoin, Blackcoin, Baycoin and others are almost instant payment to anyone in the world. They have no borders and nobody controls it. No banks control Coins. The coins are controlled by YOU the user. Everyone plays a part in keeping the network secure. The idea of &quot;decentralization&quot; is to give power back to people. We love this and are excited to see the world change. Your money will be more secure in this program than if you stored it in a bank. Banks have known to be expensive and they have been known to fail. This changes everything.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>Halo double deposit smart contracts can't be done with cash!!</span></p>
<p><span>The contracts in this program can't be done with banks or cash. Bitcoin is programmable money and using Halos protocol, you can make the money act however you want. You can force people to perform contracts, you can automatically pay interest, automatically pay bills, the sky is the limit.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>Did you know you can use coins to PROVE anything?</span></p>
<p><span>You can prove you own a coin, you can prove you own a house or an asset. Bitcoin and others can be used to record data. This data is permanent and can be used in place of notary! So now, people can have honest voting systems, secure title to property, proof that documents or pictures have not been tampered with, etc.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight:800;">What if I have any other questions?</span></p>
<p><span>This program is peer to peer. So we do like to let the community help others getting started. First try contacting someone in our BitHalo chat room in the &quot;Chat&quot; tab. This uses IRC. We suggest if you want private chats then route the traffic through Tor. There is also chat options in escrow.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>If you want to contact us, please do through the website at BitHalo.org</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:800;">Disclaimer</span></p>
<p><span>This program is &quot;obfuscated&quot; open source. This means that in order to change the source code  it would be difficult to read the source. This helps protect our source from being changed. However, it allows anyone to read the source and verify that it is secure!</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>The source code is currently copyright to Davtonia Inc. so there is no license to change and redistribute Halo without our permission. However, we do plan on allowing everyone in the world to use this source one day very soon! The source will be on GitHub for building purposes.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>This is only software, we are not liable for how you use it. This is very important to understand. If coins are not allowed in your country, then you are responsible for any consequences for the use of this program. Likewise, if you use this source to break any applicable laws, you are completely responsible for your own actions. We want the world to be free. However we also want you to be safe.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>The markets are decentralized and how you use them must be legal. To protect ourselves, we have required that anyone posting orders to the public markets, include their IP address. These addresses are encrypted so only the moderator is able to decrypt it. Also we have a moderation system for the decentralized Halo, NightTrader, and BitBay markets. We are not responsible your posts. However, moderators can be assigned and they will try their best to filter the posts. We allow moderators to volunteer to keep the markets clean. Because moderators volunteer, we cannot guarantee the markets will always be free of questionable content. Also, due to the nature of the decentralized internet, it would be impossible to moderate markets that we do not know about. In summary, it is your responsibility to use this software in a legal maner. The decentralized markets run the risk of being slower however, like Bitcoin, they have no single point of failure.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>We are not accountable for loss of coins, crashes or other default. If you read the original whitepaper we recommend against talking to the counter-party after the contract begins. Arrange everything in advance for efficiency. The last thing you want is somebody contacting you and asking for money. Stay safe. We would like you to report any bugs and you should report any illegal activity from the misuse of this software. Just like any contract in the real world, you enter into an implied two party contract every time you trade with your counter-party. This does help protect you from third party loss and it does help make the risk of default higher than the reward of theft but that does not guarantee that your counterparty will not try to misbehave. You are responsible for following the laws of your country. This software is decentralized just like Bitcoin and Blackcoin and there is no owner. This is a DAC. It is simply source code. Our attempt to promote it either tacitly or implicitly is a labor of love for open source projects. We do not know how long we will work on the source. The intention is for many developers to collaborate with and improve on BitHalo. Halo brand products are a constructive copyright. In other words... its just benevolent computer code.</span></p></body></html>
