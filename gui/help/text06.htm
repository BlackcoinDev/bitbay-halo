<p><h1>Auto Backup</h1></p>
<br />
<p><span>If this is not set, immediately set a place for this. Your contracts must be protected in case of computer failure. Since contracts are constantly being updated, we recommend using a flash drive for Backup. You may also try a cloud service for this as well. Every time anything changes in Halo, it is saved in this file. All the accounts store their information here. Every time a change is made, it is saved with the time and date of the new contracts file. To restore a backup you can copy and paste that information in place of contracts.dat.</span></p></body></html>
